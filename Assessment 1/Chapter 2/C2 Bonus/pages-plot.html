The Hanwool Financial Group's owners, Han Jin-Woong (Jeon No-Min) and his wife, Lee Jung-Hye (Lee Min-Young), adopted Han Yi-Joo (Jung Yoo-Min) as their daughter, and growing up, she learned painting. However, neither of her parents nor her younger sister Han Yoo-Ra (Jin Ji-Hee) loved her. After Han Yi-Joo's marriage to Jung Se-Hyeok (Oh Seung-Yun), she finds out that her husband just married her to be nearer to her sister, Han Yoo-Ra, because he loves her. Han Yi-Joo died in a vehicle accident but was given another chance to change her destiny.

To change her fate and take revenge on her family, she breaks off her engagement and then approaches Seo Do-Guk (Sung Hoon), whom her younger sister Han Yoo-Ra wants to marry. Seo Do-Guk is the grandson of the Taeja Groupâ€™s founder. Both agreed to enter a contract marriage, but Seo Do-Guk wants the contract marriage to become a real marriage.
