The Hanwool Financial Group's owners, Han Jin-Woong (Jeon No-Min) and his wife, Lee Jung-Hye (Lee Min-Young), adopted Han Yi-Joo (Jung Yoo-Min) as their daughter, and growing up, she learned painting. However, neither of her parents nor her younger sister Han Yoo-Ra (Jin Ji-Hee) loved her. After Han Yi-Joo's marriage to Jung Se-Hyeok (Oh Seung-Yun), she finds out that her husband just married her to be nearer to her sister, Han Yoo-Ra, because he loves her. Han Yi-Joo died in a vehicle accident but was given another chance to change her destiny.

To change her fate and take revenge on her family, she breaks off her engagement and then approaches Seo Do-Guk (Sung Hoon), whom her younger sister Han Yoo-Ra wants to marry. Seo Do-Guk is the grandson of the Taeja Groupâ€™s founder. Both agreed to enter a contract marriage, but Seo Do-Guk wants the contract marriage to become a real marriage.

<b>Very Good but not as good as the high ratings suggest (8 December 2023)</b>
This is fantasy romance drama with a great lead in Jung Yoo-Min. She's incredibly stunning her presence of camera always draws you in. Her performance also makes you easily fall for her and route for her. You could feel the wave of emotions she goes through. You smile,cry and laugh with her through it all. The main lead guy is a great compliment to her as they had great chemistry.
The show is very well made and unlike most K-dramas it doesn't drag the plot. It moves very fast to its conclusion which makes this a good drama to watch. It's not perfect but the supporting cast do a great job as they played their roles well. You know they're good when all they do is leave a bitter taste in your mouth when they're on screen.
I liked it very much although the last episode was underwhelming. It's always like this with most K-dramas they usually don't know how to close out shows. They usually end up doing the most but it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless it's a great series but definitely is a bit overrated by many viewers like many other shows.

<b>RARELY A SERIES EXCITES ME AS THIS ONE (25 November 2023)</b>
From the very first episode, I am becoming immersed in the drama and feeling excited every second. Before I start watching an episode, when I hear that it is that day, my day fills up with happiness and excitement. I just love this show so much, even though the plot has been very overused in Webtoons, this is the first TV series that uses this plot as far as I can remember. The webtoons were fun and entertaining, even though I have not read the webtoon of this, I am very satisfied with how this series is turning out. The reviews speak for itself. I highly recommend this show to people who love romance. The main actress's expressions are just so beautiful, you feel all the pain, all the tears. They are a very beautiful couple.
